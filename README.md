# Adam Wong . Jarvis Consulting

Throughout my academic and work experience, I have been introduced to a wide variety of people and technologies. With each experience, my overall mindset grew to fit each situation after determining which areas I needed to improve upon to get the most out of the experience. Whether it was learning how to communicate empathetically and efficiently with a difficult teammate. Learning to communicate concisely for a presentation or project meeting, analyzing and dissecting technologies to repurpose them for use in another project, or even learning when to ask for help after hitting a wall to ensure the project would be delivered on time, such as in my capstone project. I choose to constantly improve with whatever comes my way. I have always been passionate about constant improvement and creation, and no other role is more suited for this type of passion than a developer role.

## Jarvis Projects

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AdamWong/tree/master/linux_sql)]: As the sole developer on this project, my responsibility was to elicit the system(node) attributes and usage using regex commands, model the data using SQL and an RDBMS schema create an SRD (System Reference Document). Allowing stakeholders to identify if any modifications to their current cluster are needed, increase the number of nodes if the performance is lacking, or decrease the number of nodes if those resources are not being utilized. Using docker to initialize a PostgreSQL database to hold the values from the Linux cluster.


## Highlighted Projects
**Embedded Systems SOFE4590u**: As the sole developer on this project, my responsibility was to implement a facial detection system using OpenCV in a QEMU emulator. The first step in accomplishing this was to install the QEMU modules after determining the architecture of the system and the desired OS to be emulated. Constant debugging and much research were required to diagnose the bugs that came with the installation of QEMU and discern the best solution given the modules' purpose of operating OpenCV. This project allowed me to become more comfortable with the QEMU documentation and reading documentation as a whole. 

**YourSpot** [[GitHub](https://github.com/876ad/yourSpot)]: As the sole developer on this project, my responsibility was to implement a facial detection system using OpenCV in a QEMU emulator. The first step in accomplishing this was to install the QEMU modules after determining the architecture of the system and the desired OS to be emulated. Constant debugging and much research were required to diagnose the bugs that came with the installation of QEMU and discern the best solution given the modules' purpose of operating OpenCV. This project allowed me to become more comfortable with the QEMU documentation and reading documentation as a whole. 

**EMI calculator** [[GitHub](https://github.com/876ad/mobileAssignment)]: My role for this project was the android application developer, developing an EMI calculator. The first step was creating the different layouts and views for the UI layer where the user will be greeted and on the next page the user will be allowed to enter the data to calculate their EMI. In creating these layouts and views, fixing the constraints to ensure the UI is viewed clearly on every android device and assignment of the UI elements was necessary. The next step was to handle the user events (inputs) by modifying the state of a UI element using an event listener allowing for the return of the EMI value. 


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2022-present)**: Deployed a Linux/SQL project which monitors the system and usage attributes of each node to assess the viability of the current cluster. Through the constant and open communication of the Jarvis team, I was able to complete the project with little deviation, troubleshoot without worry, and ensure the project was implemented in the manner which was intended by the written user stories. 

**Assistant caretaker, JSPCA (2014)**: Each day was dedicated to the care of cats and dogs both young and old who have either been abused or had been living in the streets, persisting in attempting to give care when the animals stopped trusting people, communicating with potential owners and analyzing to ensure that they were the right fit for the animal given the animal's temperament.
